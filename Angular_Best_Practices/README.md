Core Module vs Shared Module vs Feature Modules
Core Module should contain any shared singleton services that are shared across multiple modules in your application. core module should also contain any app-level components. This does not mean components that are shared throughout the application, but rather, components that are only used by the top-level app component. like nav component.

Shared Module, application-wide shared components, directives, and pipes. like loading spinner component.
